</div>

A more advanced version of traditional fullbright.

## About
Traditional fullbright mods apply a nightvision filter or set the light levels all to the maximum. Dynamic Fullbright instead offers the ability to clamp or scale light levels, retaining the lighting ambience of the area while still making things visible. You can set everything to the maximum to achieve true fullbright, or tone it down to suit your preference.

## Dependencies
Optional, but required to access the in-game settings menu:
- Mod Menu
- Cloth Config
